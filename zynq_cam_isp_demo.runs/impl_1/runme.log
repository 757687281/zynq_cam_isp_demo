WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 base_i/axis_to_video_0/inst/axis_to_video_inst/fifo/ram/mem_reg_1 has an input control pin base_i/axis_to_video_0/inst/axis_to_video_inst/fifo/ram/mem_reg_1/ADDRBWRADDR[12] (net: base_i/axis_to_video_0/inst/axis_to_video_inst/fifo/ram/raddr_reg[10]) which is driven by a register (base_i/axis_to_video_0/inst/axis_to_video_inst/fifo/raddr_reg[10]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design.
